To use YourMud's OOC journalling system, take
a look at HELP JOURNAL for a listing of the proper syntax.
~
If you need to roleplay with an NPC, feel free to petition
up to request a staff member to animate them!
~
To turn these off, type SET HINTS. You may re-enable them 
at any time by typing SET HINTS again.
~
MudMail is our built in mudmailer system. To access 
it, quit out and choose from the menu.
~
If your character is a non-combative sort, don't forget to 
SET the PACIFIST and AUTOFLEE flags!
~
Another commonly used command is SCAN, which allows you to 
survey nearby rooms. You may either use it without an 
argument, or with a direction specified.
~
YourMud is a role-play intensive MUD, and not 
what's called 'hack-and-slash'. Thus, roleplay is required 
above all else: our primary focus is to enjoy developing 
our characters in a way that isn't limited to skills.
~
The SCRIBE command is used to choose which script you 
would like your character to write in.
~
Use the SPEAK command to choose which language you would 
like your character to speak in.
~
Coded character progress is represented here in skills, 
not experience points. So, you will only improve at a 
specific thing if you practice it. Be aware, however, 
that there are a number of measures in place to thwart 
scripters and powergamers.
~
There is a small difference between the TALK and SAY 
commands. When you SAY something, everyone in the room 
will hear it. However, if you are sitting at a table 
and you use TALK, only those at your table will be able 
to hear it without making a listen check.
~
In YourMud, there are four primary means
of communication: say, tell, shout and whisper. All
but shout require that the person you wish to hear
what you've said be in the same room; shouting has a
radius of one room in all directions.
~
To open a door when there are multiple doors in the room,
you type 'open <door name> <direction>', e.g. 'open gate
west'; closing them works in the same fashion.
~
The SKILLS command displays your current skill ratings.
~
Type HEALTH for a detailed display of any wounds you have.
~
The FOLLOW command allows you to passively follow someone.
~
As YourMud is a role-play intensive MUD, there
are no channels here - except in very special circumstances,
such as telepathy, you are only able to communicate with
those other characters whom are in the room with yours.
~
If you have any questions or concerns and need to reach a
member of staff, the syntax is: 'petition all <message>'.
However, please do not use this command superfluously!
~
Our staff email address is staff@yourmud.com.
~
CRAFTS represent your character's ability to do certain
things, from sewing tunics to building campfires. We have
crafts for all manner of different skills; if you feel
that your character should have some, petition up about it.
~
To get a list of your character's known crafts, use the
CRAFTS command. To see a list of required materials, skill
checks, and phase times for a given craft, use the MATERIALS
command, e.g. 'materials breadloaf'.
~
HIT and KILL are two different commands here. When you HIT
someone, you will automatically stop should they collapse,
and you will also accept their surrender. If you KILL
someone, you will fight them until they are dead. You may
change between the two modes in the middle of combat.
~
Law enforcers in YourMud, unlike today's police, are
authorized and even predisposed to use lethal force. When
they discover a criminal, they will attack him until he has
been rendered unconscious, and then drag him off to jail;
however, sometimes accidents happen, and he is killed. If
you are wanted for only a minor crime, it is highly advised
that you SURRENDER to the nearest guard.
~
Liberal use of the THINK command will help the admins get a
feel for your character's reactions, and is encouraged as a
cornerstone of excellent roleplay.
~
YourMud is a role-play intensive MUD. Thus, OOC
chatter is prohibited in the game itself, save in small
doses to assist new players. If you'd like to hang out with
your fellow players and staff OOC, log in as a guest.
~
If you're a new player and you have questions you'd
like to ask other players, use the OOC command - it's like 
a SAY, but it's out-of-character; use it sparingly.
~
Unlike most MUDs, there is a delay here when you move your
character around in the game world. The delay is either
shorter or longer depending on your pace; look for 'walk
speeds' under 'Movement' when you type SET ? to see a
list of the various speeds you can move at.
~
The SET command is extremely versatile, and important. For
a list of configurable options, type SET ?.
~
Unlike many other MUDs, in YourMud it is possible,
and often even encouraged, to have your PC make his or her
living as something else besides a typical warrior; a cheery
barmaid, a wise old scholar, or a dour armorsmith are only
a few of the possibilities. The goal, above all else, is RP!

A few commonly used terms:

    RP: Roleplay
    IC: In-Character
    OOC: Out-of-Character
    Pof: Player Of
