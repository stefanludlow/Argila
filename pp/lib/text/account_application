To play YourMud, you must first register for an account. The 
registration process simply consists of entering a desired username, and 
an email at which we can reach you. Note that an account handle does NOT 
need to be "in character" -- that is, "jdoe81" is perfectly acceptable.

Your account will enable you to do a variety of things; most importantly, 
it will store all of the characters that you play here. Although multiplaying 
is strictly prohibited, your past characters will be available to you via the 
account menu for reference purposes. In addition, you will be able to send
and receive mudmail, set personal display preferences, and much more.

Please note that our policies prohibit a person from having multiple accounts,
and furthermore that your account name CANNOT BE the name of a PC you intend
to play on that account, in order to protect in-character information. If you
submit an application for a character sharing the same name as the account you
register here, it will be rejected out of hand, so please observe this rule!
