You will now be required to enter the 'physical' description of your
character. The description is required to be between four and ten full
lines in length and should not indicate how the character thinks or
feels. It must be as objective as possible; tell us how your character
LOOKS, not what other people may think about it. Please do not write in 
the second person (i.e., no 'you see', 'before you', etc). Lastly, do not
mention any specific equipment or clothing that the character might be
wearing, as this will be displayed seperately once you are in the game.

Example:

   A thick braid of sandy-brown hair falls down this woman's back, tied off
   near her waist with a strip of leather. Several strands have been left free
   to frame her face, tangled up with small beads and feathers. Her eyes are an
   alert shade of grey and set beneath thick, slightly arched eyebrows. Her
   youthful features have already been marred by a countless number of scars,
   one in particular that wends its way over the bridge of her crooked nose.
   Her frame is tall and lithe, composed of feminine curves and sinewy muscle.
