   Select six starting skills from the list below.  Once chosen, skills 
can be mastered 'in game' through practice.  Please note that skill 
advancement is restricted by time, and thus power-mudding in an attempt to 
quickly master your skills will be futile. Once in-game, you may learn
new skills only by finding other player-characters to teach them to you.

   #2When finished choosing skills, type DONE at the prompt.#0
