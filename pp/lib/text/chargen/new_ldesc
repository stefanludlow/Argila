You will now be required to enter the long, or 'one line' description
of your character.  This is the text that other players will see when
they see your character within a room.  Incorporate the features you
noted in your short description. Be sure to start the description with 
'A' or 'An', and to use a complete sentence.

     Examples:     - A golden-haired, emerald-eyed young lass is here.
                   - A towering, raven-haired man stands here quietly.
