Please take this space to enter your character's background. It can
include his or her motivations, personal history, character traits,
goals, and anything else you feel appropriate. It will help our staff
find a niche for your character, and to develop roleplay integrating
your desired character concept. When you have finished entering your
text, you may exit the editor by placing a '@' symbol on its own line.


Be sure to avoid pasting your background into this section from a
word processor, as it will likely disconnect you if you do so.
