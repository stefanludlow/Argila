Select the physical aspects of your character's body.  This is broken
down into two basic catagories; frame and height, and will be used for
sizing the various equipment found in the game.  Size will also be used
for determining modifiers to your character, such as weight.

Please note that both aspects are relative to your character's race; to
many a Hobbit's chagrin, they just don't measure up to the Haradrim!

Please type the height and frame on one line, using the list below.

   Heights       - Short, Average, Tall
   Frames        - Scant, Light, Medium, Heavy, Massive

   Examples:
              
       >short heavy
       >tall scant
