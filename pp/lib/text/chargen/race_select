The following is a listing of all PC races available for play within 
YourMud. Eligibility to play any given race is determined 
by the number of roleplay points you have accrued on your account. 

Unlike roles, choosing a restricted race (that is, anything but a
Human or a Goblin) will cost you a small portion of that race's 
point requirement for the privilege. This is done to ensure that the
rarer races stay correspondingly rare. However, points will only be
deducted from your account after a "grace period" consisting of a
few hours of playtime - so you will not be docked points if you
happen to lose your character not long after creating him or her.
