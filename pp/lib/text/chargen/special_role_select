Congratulations! It would appear that you have accrued some roleplay
points, and that there are available roles for which you qualify.

Below is a list of 'classifieds', or needed roles that have been made
available by the administrative staff. This list of roles will change
over time, as entries are added and removed by staff to reflect the
need in-game for certain professions and particular character roles.

Unlike races, these roles DO NOT deduct roleplay points from your
account after you have spent a period of time playing your PC.

Please select an entry from the list below for more information, or
simply enter a 0 at the prompt to pass and continue on without one.
