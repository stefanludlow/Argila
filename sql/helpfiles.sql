You should\n   also know what sort of items your shop will buy and sell; food,\n   weapons, etc...\n\n2) Use the MSET KEEPER command to initialize the shopkeeper. If\n   this is not a newly created mob, you will probably want to\n   start editing it with MOB <vnum>. If the shop is a room, the\n   FLAG of the keeper should include Sentinel. Leave this flag out\n   if you wish to make a wandering merchant. For the sake of simplicity\n   you might want to consider making a mob with the same v-number as\n   the room his shop is located in.\n\n3) Next, RINIT the storeroom. A shop keeper does not keep his goods\n   in his inventory; all items are placed in the storeroom. ALL\n   storerooms should be located in zone 0.\n\n4) Now use the \"LOAD obj <obj vnum>\" inside your storeroom to place\n   the items for sale in your shopkeeper\'s listing. A shop should\n   generally not contain more than 6-7 items; this will provide the\n   player a decent amount of variety, while not giving him or her\n   access to too many items in one location. Now, when you type \"list\"\n   in the same room as your shopkeeper, you should see all the items\n   you just loaded into his storeroom.\n\n5) A shop can \"reproduce\" an unlimited supply of up to five items. This\n   adds a bit of \"reality\" to the game. If you were in a tavern, you\n   should be able to purchase more than one tankard of ale. The MSET\n   DELIVERY command allows you to specify which items you want your\n   shop to reproduce. Note: Some discretion should be used in specifying\n   which items will be reproduced. For example, it would be common for\n   a keeper to reproduce an unlimited supply of ale, but not for a\n   weapons-maker to reproduce the finest chainmail, or the best sword,\n   without limit. Therefore, do not set \"quality\", \"complex\", or \"unique\"\n   items with MSET DELIVERY.\n\n6) To set the types of items a shop will purchase from players, use the\n   MSET BUY command. Note: Some items should not be set with BUY --\n   trash, food, other, and note. However, setting these items to not be\n   bought with MSET NOBUY is a good idea.\n\n7) Another thing to set when making a shop is its buy and sell profit\n   values. The MSET DISC command sets the percent value that the keeper\n   will try to purchase the item for. Example: MSET DISC 0.75 would mean\n   that the shopkeeper would try to buy an item off the player at 75% of\n   its real value. Similarly, with MSET MARK 1.1, the keeper will try to\n   sell the item at 10% more than its cost.\n\n','(null)',1,'Sat May 14 00:08:53 2003','Traithe'),('Rdflag','Building','\nUsage: rdflag <direction> <door flag>\n\nToggles the flags for the door in the given direction.\nCurrently you can set only the PICKPROOF flag.

Effectively they serve\ntwo purposes: to gather together workers producing similar\nsorts of goods so that the economies of having a communal\nworkplace are achieved, and also to provide a fellowship, a\nsort of club that workers in that industry can join in order\nto gain political and social benefits. The social benefits\ninclude looking after widows and orphans of workers and, on\na much lighter note, revelries and get-togethers of like-\nminded fellows (and ladies) after a hard day\'s work.\n\nIn general, there are three distinctions within the Fellowships;\napprentices, journeymen, and full-fledged Fellows. A Fellow is\nreferred to by the title of his Fellowship, e.g. \'Scribe\',\n\'Porter\', \'Healer\', and so on. Apprentices and journeymen have\nno title, and their periods of training vary by their trade.\n\nGenerally, apprenticeship begins anywhere from the young age\nof 10 for the more \'learned\' guilds such as the Sages and\nHealers, to the more seasoned age of 14 for the more \'physical\'\nguilds such as the Ironsmiths or Locksmiths. Depending upon\nthe trade, it will last anywhere from 3-8 years.\n\nJourneymanship is a period of time during which the individual\nis able to travel and serve under Fellows of their own choosing,\nprovided they are able to take on another pupil. While not\ncrafters in their own right, journeyman are valued for their\n(often underpaid) assistance in running shops and businesses.\nIt usually lasts for a period of 2-4 years, depending on trade.\n\nAfter having completed a stint of journeymanship satisfactorily\nwith two Fellows - written letters of recommendation must be\nprovided - the aspiring journeyman returns to Minas Tirith,\nwhere he or she undergoes a test at their Fellowship Hall.\n\nShould the examination be completed successfully, they are\nawarded the status of a full Fellow; else, they are allowed\nto take it once more, once a year\'s waiting period has passed.\n\n','(null)',0,'Mon May 19 05:36:27 2003','Traithe'),('Doorwardens','Clans','\nThe Fellowship of Doorwardens\n\nSee HELP PORTERS for the text of this entry.\n\n','(null)',0,'Mon May 19 05:37:46 2003','Traithe'),('Porters','Clans','\nThe Fellowship of Porters and Doorwardens\n\nThis Fellowship is a small but important one.

Unlike other MU*s, where characters tend\r\nto progress along static, pre-determined paths, our system of craft\r\nbranching is entirely dynamic - that is to say, when your character\r\nbranches a craft what s/he learns next is determined by a number of\r\nfluid factors beyond merely which subcraft s/he just completed. These\r\nfactors include your character\'s skill level, their race, their clan\r\naffiliations and ranks, and finally any items that are either REQUIRED\r\nor PRODUCED by the subcraft you just completed.\r\n\r\nThe order of precedence in craft branching is down, then up. Think\r\nof it this way; in order to create complex and interesting items,\r\nyour character must first learn the fundamentals.\r\n\r\nFor an example, let us examine the #6cast bronze-sword-guards#0 craft.\r\n\r\nThese sword guards are used in the creation of a number of different\r\nitems, ranging from practice blades to real weapons. However, before\r\nwe can fashion full blades from them, we must first learn to create\r\nthe wax crossguard required by the sword-guards craft itself. Thus,\r\nthe first time we branch a subcraft after successfully crafting a \r\nsword-guard, we will be given the #6pour wax-crossguard#0 technique.\r\n\r\nAfter learning to pour a wax-crossguard, if we pass another branch\r\ncheck with the bronze-sword-guards craft, the code will automatically\r\nlook UP the tree at what crafts require what we just produced, since\r\nwe now have all the crafts to produce what sword-guards REQUIRES.\r\n\r\nIn this case, it would immediately catch upon an #6assemble sword#0\r\ncraft. However, we don\'t quite know how to make all the ingredients\r\nrequired to assemble any sword yet; specifically, we\'ll still need\r\nto be able to forge a bronze pommel before doing so. Therefore, the\r\nsubcraft we branch second will be #6cast bronze-pommel#0.\r\n\r\nWhen we pass a branching check for the third time, rather like we\r\npreviously learned to pour the wax crossguard model, this time we will\r\nlearn the #6pour wax-pommel#0 subcraft to round out our knowledge.\r\n\r\nNow that we know how to construct the lower part of the sword, we\'ll\r\nnaturally progress to learning how to forge a blade; therefore, our\r\nfourth successful branching check will bring us #6forge longsword-blade.#0\r\n\r\nFinally, we have the fundamentals! Namely, cast bronze-sword-guards,\r\npour wax-crossguard, cast bronze-pommel, pour wax-pommel, and forge\r\nlongsword-blade. Therefore, upon passing a branch check after using \r\nANY of these crafts, we will finally learn the \"crown jewel\", so to \r\nspeak: #6assemble longsword#0. Because our system is dynamic and\r\ntherefore intelligent in a way static progressions are not, it means\r\nthat no matter where you start along the \"tree\" of the #6assemble\r\nlongsword#0 craft, you will fill it out completely and eventually\r\nreach the apex. See the diagram below:\r\n\r\n                           #6assemble longsword#0\r\n                                    ^\r\n                                    |\r\n                          #6forge longsword-blade#0\r\n                                    ^\r\n                                    |\r\n              ----------------------------------------------\r\n              |                                            |\r\n   #6cast bronze-sword-guards#0                       #6cast bronze-pommel#0\r\n              ^                                            ^\r\n              |                                            |\r\n     #6pour wax-crossguard#0                            #6pour wax-pommel#0\r\n                                                            \r\nThe power of this system of branching lies in its dynamism and its\r\nfluidity. Thus, the branching path demonstrated above will not always\r\napply to all characters; depending upon which specific crafts they use \r\nin which order, and what their skill levels are, they may learn to forge\r\nshortswords first, or even practice blades. The only constant is that\r\nthe system will automatically search for any related crafts that you\r\nqualify to be assigned -before- it opens a random new craft for you.\r\n\r\nThe only circumstance in which you will branch an entirely unrelated\r\nsubcraft is if the system can find no subcrafts related to the one you\r\njust completed for which you qualify. The echo you receive when you\r\nactually branch a craft will inform you whether or not the new craft\r\nis related to what you just completed, or if it is entirely new.\r\n\r\nNote that even when the code assigns random, unrelated crafts, there\r\nare still requirements that those crafts may or may not have; thus,\r\nApprentices will not mysteriously branch Master-level crafts, Goblins\r\nwill not learn to make Elvish blades, and so on.\r\n\r\nFinally, please note that craft branching ONLY applies to other\r\nsubcrafts within the craft category of the subcraft you completed\r\nbefore passing your branch check. Therefore, weaponcraft subcrafts \r\nwill only branch into other weaponcraft subcrafts, hunting craft\r\nsubcrafts will only branch into other hunting craft subcrafts, etc.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to learn more subcrafts in a category, you must use the\r\nopening crafts you are given (those marked with an asterisk on the\r\nfull crafts listing on our website), and practice them diligently.\r\n\r\n','Crafts Teach',0,'Friday, 01:56:50 pm, 30th April 2004','Traithe'),('Nopetition','Staff','Usage: mset nopetition\r\n\r\nThe NOPETITION flag prevents the character so set from using the\r\npetition command; in addition, it carries over to all other characters\r\non their account, as well as any guest logins coming from their IP.\r\n\r\n','Noban Noguest',3,'Saturday, 02:33:24 am, 1st May 2004','Traithe'),('Noguest','Staff','Usage: mset noguest\r\n\r\nThe NOGUEST flag set on a character will prevent anyone sharing their\r\naccount\'s IP address from logging into our guest lounge.\r\n\r\n','Noban Nogain Nopetition',3,'Saturday, 02:34:07 am, 1st May 2004','Traithe'),('Noban','Staff','Usage: mset noban\r\n\r\nThe NOBAN flag, when set on a character, will prevent their account\r\nfrom being locked out by any sitebans that would otherwise prevent\r\nthem from logging into the MUD server.\r\n\r\n','Nogain Noguest Nopetition',3,'Saturday, 02:35:30 am, 1st May 2004','Traithe'),('Roster','General','To see a current roster of staff members and their clan assignments, visit:\r\n\r\n   #6http://www.middle-earth.us/index.php?display=staff\r\n\r\n','',0,'Saturday, 02:42:02 am, 1st May 2004','Traithe'),('Accent','General','Depending on your skill in a particular language, a character may have an\r\nakward accent that will be displayed by the code when they speak.

While there are many \r\nmore commands than are listed here, these tips should hopefully \r\nbe enough for a first-time player to get started.\r\n\r\n#6Movement#0\r\n\r\nNORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST - These are the basic movement commands, \r\nand can be abbreviated to N, S, E, and W. Using these will take \r\nyou to the next room in that direction. Movement is not \r\ninstantaneous like in other MUDS, but takes a little time, \r\ndepending on the speed you\'re moving. To change the speed of \r\nmovement, use the SET command, which will be discussed later.\r\n\r\nSIT, REST, SLEEP, STAND, WAKE - These commands are fairly self \r\nexplanatory. While sitting, your character is considered to be \r\nupright, and while resting, your character is assumed to be lying \r\ndown. You may use SIT, REST, and SLEEP with items in the game, \r\nfor example:\r\n\r\nsit chair\r\n\r\nwould make you sit on a chair, if one is present in the room. If \r\nthere is more than one piece of furniture in the room, you can \r\nsee a list of it by typing TABLES.\r\n\r\nThe STAND command has another use - it can be used to position \r\nyourself at the edge of a room, so you can easily LOOK into any \r\nadjacent room. To use it, STAND <direction>.\r\n\r\n#6Communication#0\r\n\r\nEMOTE - This command allows you to have your character perform \r\nan action. Anyone else in the room will see the specified action. \r\nFor example, if #5a bald, fat man#0 typed this:\r\n\r\nemote pretends to be a camel.\r\n\r\nthe rest of the room would see:\r\n\r\n#5A bald, fat man#0 pretends to be a camel.\r\n\r\nTo specify another player or item in an emote, use a tilde (for \r\nplayers or mobs) or asterisk (for items) before the player or \r\nitem\'s keyword. If #5a bald, fat man#0 is in a room with \r\n#5a thin, red-haired woman#0 and a #2heavy, iron anvil#0, and \r\ntypes:\r\n\r\nemote sits down on *anvil, shaking his head at (tilde)woman.\r\n\r\nthe rest of the room would see:\r\n\r\n#5A bald, fat man#0 sits down on #2a heavy, iron anvil#0, shaking \r\nhis head at #5a thin, red-haired woman#0.\r\n\r\nSAY - The basic communication command, SAY lets you send a message \r\nto  the rest of the room. To precede the say with an emote, place \r\nthe emote in parenthesis before the message. #5A bald, fat man#0 \r\nmight type:\r\n\r\nsay (shaking his head) No, I don\'t like whiskey.\r\n\r\nand the rest of the room would see:\r\n\r\n#5A bald, fat man#0 says in Westron, shaking his head,\r\n   \"No, I don\'t like whiskey.\"\r\n\r\nIf you are able to speak more than one language, you can change \r\nwhich language you are speaking in by typing SPEAK <language>.\r\n\r\nTALK - If you are seated at a table, the TALK command will send a \r\nmessage only to those who are seated at the same table. Others in \r\nthe room, if skilled at listening, may overhear fragments of your \r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nTELL - The tell command is like SAY, but targets another player \r\nspecifically. Simply put the player\'s (or mob\'s) keyword before \r\nthe words to be spoken. The rest of the room WILL hear this message.\r\n\r\nWHISPER - The WHISPER command is like TELL, but sends a message \r\nto one other person ONLY, who you must target. For example, \r\n#5a bald, fat man#0 might type this:\r\n\r\nwhisper woman No, I don\'t like whiskey.\r\n\r\nThe woman would receive the message, while the rest of the room \r\nwould hear nothing (or receive only fragments).\r\n\r\nSHOUT - This command allows you shout, letting adjacent rooms \r\nhear your words. It works like SAY, but anyone in a nearby room \r\nwill be able to hear you (although they will not neccessarily know\r\nwho is shouting).\r\n\r\nTHINK - The THINK command lets you think a private message, which \r\nonly the administrators can see.\r\n\r\nNOTIFY - You can use this command to notify entire clans or specific \r\npeople, letting them know you\'re online and looking for roleplay. \r\nConversely, you can also use this to respond to a notify sent to you,\r\nletting the notifier know you\'re online.\r\n\r\nPETITION - PETITION is an Out of Character method of communication \r\nwith the administrators. You may:\r\n\r\npetition all <message>\r\n\r\nto address all administrators online at the time, or\r\nto target a specific one:\r\n\r\npetition Traithe <message>\r\n\r\nHOBBITMAIL - Accessible via option H from the account login menu, \r\nHobbitmail can be used to communicate with other players. It\'s a \r\ngreat way to contact clan leaders or people you need to speak with \r\nICly, and set up times to catch them online and RP.\r\n\r\n#6Information#0\r\n\r\nSCORE - SCORE shows you the statistics of your character;\r\nyour name, age, a rough estimate of your physical attributes,\r\nwhether you are hungry or thirsty, and other helpful things.\r\n\r\nCOUNT - This command searches through all the containers worn\r\non your person and counts up the coins you have. This takes a\r\nlittle bit of time to do, so be patient.\r\n\r\nINVENTORY, EQUIPMENT - These commands let you see what you\'re\r\nwearing and holding.\r\n\r\nTIME - This shows you the IC time and date, currently, in the game.\r\n\r\nWEATHER - If you are outside, this command gives you information\r\nabout the current weather.\r\n\r\nSEARCH - This command allows you to search a room for hidden\r\nobjects or players, and can also be used to search a direction for\r\nhidden exits. To do this, simply SEARCH <direction>.\r\n\r\nSKILLS - Shows you a list of the skills you currently know, and a rough\r\nestimate of how good you are at them.\r\n\r\n#6Manipulation#0\r\n\r\nGET - This will pick up an object in the room, or take an item from\r\na container. To do this, simply GET <item> or GET <item> <container>.\r\nRemember that you can only hold two items at a time, one in each\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nDROP, PUT - These commands are the opposite of GET, letting you\r\ndrop an item on the floor or put an item in a container. To put an item\r\ninto another, PUT <item> <container>.\r\n\r\nGIVE - GIVE allows you to pass an item from your possession to another\'s.\r\nTo use it, GIVE <item> <player>.\r\n\r\nOPEN, CLOSE - These commands allow you to open or close doors,\r\ngates, curtains, and the like. If there is more than one door in a room,\r\nyou can OPEN <door> <direction>. You may also have to open or\r\nclose certain containers.\r\n\r\nKNOCK - This allows you to knock on a door, letting anybody behind\r\nit know that someone\'s there. To use it, KNOCK <door> or\r\nKNOCK <door> <direction>.\r\n\r\nEAT, DRINK - Use these commands to eat or drink an item you\'re holding,\r\nor to take a drink from a nearby water source, such as a well or fountain.\r\n\r\nFILL - Fill is used to fill a drink container from a water source. Simply\r\nFILL <container> <water source>.\r\n\r\nLIGHT - This command can be used to light a candle, torch, lantern, or\r\nother light source. To extinguish the light source, LIGHT <item> off.\r\n\r\nWEAR, WIELD - These commands allow you to manipulate objects\r\nin your possession. WEAR will wear a piece of clothing or armor on the\r\nappropriate place, and WIELD will brandish a weapon.\r\n\r\nSWITCH - Switch simply moves what you\'re holding in your left hand\r\nto your right, and vice versa.\r\n\r\n','Built_areas Chargen Commence Employment Hints Mentor Roleplay-Points Roleplay-points',0,'Thursday, 09:21:50 am, 13th May 2004','Haiwolfe'),('Writings','Staff','The WRITINGS command is the basic interface to the table in our database that\r\nstores all in-character player writings.

Of course, weapons designed for such\r\nuse will tend to be more effective, but any weapon, regardless of design,\r\nwill do a small amount of damage when successfully hurled at someone.\r\nOther objects, unless extremely weighty, will do no damage at all.\r\n\r\nYou will be able to identify weapons that are suitable for throwing by\r\n#6LOOK#0ing at them; a line will be appended to their full descriptions\r\nimmediately following what base skill they use, indicating as much.\r\n\r\nLike archery, you will not be able to throw at a target in an adjacent room\r\nunless you have sighted them first via SCAN. Unlike archery, there are no\r\nbuilt-in delays to this command. However, thrown weapons tend to be\r\nless damaging than their archery-based counterparts.\r\n\r\nThrowing works on the principle of balance. When your character throws\r\nan object, this will take him or her off-balance. While off-balance, any\r\nsubsequent throws are made with penalties to their skill checks, and will\r\nthrow you even further off-balance. How much balance you \"lose\" per\r\nthrow is depdendent upon your character\'s attributes. When you become\r\nfully balanced again after a throw, you will receive a message stating such.\r\n\r\nThe command checks against your PC\'s #6THROWING#0 skill.\r\n\r\nSome examples:\r\n\r\n  > throw dagger goblin\r\n  > throw tankard north\r\n  > throw dart north black-haired\r\n\r\n','Aim Archery Balance Fire General Throwing',0,'Wednesday, 01:38:56 am, 23rd June 2004','Traithe'),('Whirl','Combat','Usage: whirl\r\n\r\nThe WHIRL command is used to prepare to fire an equipped and\r\nloaded sling weapon at a given target.

Note that all commands are expanded\r\nby the parser before being logged - e.g. a \'command emote\' will\r\nturn up someone who enters \'emo does a little dance.\' Commands are\r\nstored in a separate field from their arguments to ensure that you \r\ncan, for example, search for the think command without turning \r\nup log lines like \'say I think I\'m a clueless moron.\'\r\n\r\nroom <room ##> : Only returns log entries generated in the\r\nspecified room.\r\n\r\nminutes <X> : Only searches log entries generated within the\r\nlast X minutes.\r\n\r\nhours <X> : Only searches log entries generated within the last\r\nX hours.\r\n\r\ndays <X> : Only searches log entries generated within the last\r\nX days.\r\n\r\nguest : Searches through the guest log for the specified terms.\r\n\r\nimmortal : Searches through the staff log for the specified terms.\r\nNote that only level 5 staff members can access this.\r\n\r\nsystem : Searches through the system log for the specified terms.\r\n\r\nerror : Searches through the system log for the specified terms,\r\nand will only return entries flagged as critical errors.\r\n\r\nascend : Normally, the output given by this command is sorted\r\nso that the newest entries are displayed first, and the oldest at\r\nthe bottom of the list.
