Persistent Mobiles

The Shadows of Isildur persistent mobile database allows for two
different types of NPCs; spawn NPCs, or unique NPCs.

To build a spawn NPC, which will automatically be replaced by a
similarly-equipped NPC of the same VNUM when it dies, you must
load and equip the mobile on our builder port. This will then be
a "spawn point" on the player port; when an NPC generated by
one of these spawn points is killed or purged, a reset will be put
in place that will cause a new copy that NPC's VNUM to re-load at 
its initial spawn point within approximately 24 in-game hours.

If, on the other hand, you wish to build a unique NPC, e.g. a mob
that will not "re-pop" after it has been killed, you merely need to
load it up and equip it on the player port. This replaces the old
STAYPUT command which was necessary under the system.


============++++++++++++============
Usage: minit <vnum>

Creates a new mobile in the current room. You might consider
using the FREEZE command to keep the mobiles from wandering
while you edit (although this is not necessary on the builder
port). You may use the MUNUSED command to get a list of available
vnums for the particular zone you're using.

============++++++++++++============
Building: Mset

Mset is used to modify mobs and players. Typing 'mset ?' will
also give you this help list.

Usage:

        mset [mob-vnum]                 Optionally specify mob vnum
        name                            "keywords"
        sdesc                           "a short name"
        ldesc                           "The long desc"
        desc                            Enter a full description

        params that take a simple numberic value:

=============+++++++++++++++++==============
Usage: mcopy <target mob's name>

This command duplicates one in-game instance of a mob,
including worn equipment; useful for whipping up swarms
of raiders in a only a few minutes.

NOTE: Please remember the value we place on quality
over quantity, and don't abuse this command. Thanks.
Example:

  > mcopy goblin
=============+++++++++++++++++==============
Usage: mclone <target VNUM>

Clones one mob to another. This also works across
zones, and so is useful for making similar mobs in
different zones.

The mob you are cloning is the one currently open
in your editor, via the MOBILE command.

NOTE: Please remember the value we place on quality
over quantity, and don't abuse this command. Thanks.
=============+++++++++++++++++==============
Usage: munused <zone number>

The MUNUSED command can provide a list of available Mob-vnums within the desired zone.
=============+++++++++++++++++==============
Usage: freeze <zone>

Stops all mobile activity updates for the specified zone. Use
this to prevent mobiles from wandering during build/save periods.
Use THAW to reverse the affects of this command.

Note that ALL ZONES on the builder port are frozen by
default; this is why mobs do not wander, attack, or activate
mprogs. Please use this command sparingly on the player port.

=============+++++++++++++++++==============
Usage: thaw <zone>

Re-enables mobile activity updates in the specified zone.
Mobiles will wander and perform special functions as in
normal game play. This command is used in conjunction with
the FREEZE command.

=============+++++++++++++++++==============
locate [+/-mob name]
       [zone]
       [virtual]
       act "<action-bits>"
       [clan name]
       clan <clan name>
       [position]
       
This command finds a desired mobile.

Example:

  locate +fiery-haired -male <zone number>
