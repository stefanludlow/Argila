Commands related to rooms in the game, creating a room, room wide items, exits and doors, secret and hiddden information. At the end will be a listing of the flags and sectors.

rpadd
	 Usage: rpadd 
	 Adds a new room program to the end of the current program list.
	 
show a - Show object/mobile/player/room totals by zone.	 
show r <zone> [low][high]- Show names and exit informations for these rooms.	 
show s                   - Show grand totals for building and pfiles.
show u <zone>            - Show a list of undescribed rooms in given zone.
+++++++++++++++++++++ CREATE ROOMS +++++++++++++++++++++++++

rinit
	Usage: rinit <room vnum>
	Creates a new room. You must use goto, rexit, or rlink to get to the
	room to work with it. 

rdelete
	Usage: rdelete <room vnum>
	Delete the specified room and all connections to/from that room.

+++++++++++++++++++++ ROOM WIDE +++++++++++++++++++++++++

rflags 
	Usage: rflags [flag | ?]
	With no argument, it will list the flags for the current room. If a
	room flag is used as the argument, it will toggle that flag. Using
	the ? will give a listing of all flags available.  (Note: In the
	orginal distribution of the SOI engine, there are two helpfiles
	available, rflag and rflags. The first one explains all of the room
	flag types, and the second one is just a summary.)
 
rsector 
	Usage: rsector [sectortype | ?]
	With no argument, it will list the sector for the current room. If a
	rsector flag is used as the argument, it will toggle that flag.
	Using the ? will give a listing of all sectors available, as well as
	movement costs, and other notes.

rname 
	Usage: rname <room name>
	This will create a name or change the name of the room you are
	currently in.
	
rdesc
	Usage: rdesc [reformat]
	Allows entry of a new description for the room you are currently
	in. With no arguments, it will send you into the editor to enter
	your description.  Use "rdesc reformat" to ensure
	proper formating once you are done with the description.

rset
	Usage: rset [<weather> | alas <direction>]
	rset <weather> can be used to give the room a different description
	depending on 'weather' such as foggy, rainy, day or night. A complete
	listing of available 'weather' descriptions can be found with the command
	"tags weather-room". "rdesc reformat" will not work on weather-descriptions,
	so be certain the formating is correct.
	
	"rset alas" is used to give an alternate message to a direction that cannot
	be used. For example if there is no exit to the west, then "rset alas w"
	will allow you to give the player a message when they try to move west. 
	
rappend
	Usage: rappend
	To add material to a pre-existing room description. (Note: remeber
	to use "rdesc reformat" when you are done)
	
+++++++++++++++++++++ DOORS AND EXITS +++++++++++++++++++++++++
**On the commands below "Direction" must be one of (n, e, s, w, u, d).

rlink 
	Usage: rlink <direction><target room>
	Creates a two-way connection between the room you are currently in 
	and the target room. Both rooms must exist before you try to link 
	them. The link is removed by using the "rlinkrm" command.

rlinkrm 
	Usage: rlinkrm <direction>
	Removes a two-way link between two rooms in the direction specified.
	The doors and other exit descriptions are also removed.

rexit 
	Usage: rexit <directio><target room>
	Creates a one-way passage in the specified direction to the
	target room from the current room. Both rooms must exist. The exit
	is removed with the REXITRM command.

rexitrm
	Usage: rexitrm <direction>
	Removes a one-way link to the room in the direction specified.
	The doors and other exit descriptions are also removed.
	
rdoor 
	Usage: rdoor <direction> [keyword(s)] 
	Creates a door in the specified direction, if a link or one-way exit
	exists in that direction. A keyword may be specified if desired; the
	default is "door". 

rkey 
	Usage: rkey <direction><key number(VNUM)><pick penalty> 
	Allows the door in the direction given to be locked and
	unlocked using a key with the specified VNUM. A pick penalty can be
	set also. Creation and placement of this key is the responsibility
	of the builder,

rdflag 
	Usage: rdflag <direction> <flag>  
	If this command is used with just a direction, it will ask for a
	flag from exit-bits. At this time, only pickproff is functional. See
	the flags section for the full list of exit-bits.
	
rset
	Usage: rset alas <direction>
	"rset alas" is used to give an alternate message to a direction that cannot
	be used. For example if there is no exit to the west, then "rset alas w"
	will allow you to give the player a message when they try to move west.
	
+++++++++++++++++++++ EXTRA DETAILS +++++++++++++++++++++++++

rddesc
	Usage: rddesc <direction>
	Adds a description for an exit (a door does not need to
	be present) in the specified direction. You will be prompted
	for the description after entering the command.


rcret
	Usage: rcret <direction><difficulty>
	RCRET creates a secret description which can only be found through
	a successful use of the SEARCH skill. The difficulty will be a
	number from 0 to 100. Please note that a difficulty of 50 or
	greater, due to modifications in the code, will be IMPOSSIBLE to
	find. A good range is 0-20, with a preference to the more
	conservative numbers. Once the command is entered, you will go to
	the editor to type the actual description you desire.


redesc
	Usage: redesc <keyword(s)>
	Adds a keyword and extra description for something in the current
	room. After the command with the keyword is given, you will be
	prompted for a description. This is useful for describing signs and
	anything else that need not be an object or will not be taken from
	the room.
