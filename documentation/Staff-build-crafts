Building: Crafts

The CRAFT command is our craft OLC's equivalent to the OBJECT
and MOBILE commands. Essentially, when entered by itself, it
lists all crafts currently in-game. When given an argument,
and that argument corresponds to the subcraft name of an
existing craft, it opens that craft for editing. Once a craft
is opened for editing, typing CRAFT by itself again will show
all stored information on that craft.

Its first use is to access a player's list of crafts, with:

       craft <player name>

It can also be used to initialize a new craft, using:

       craft new <craft> <subcraft> <command>

Additionally, if you have the craftfile open in your editor,
you can still obtain the full list of crafts using "craft list".
Lastly, it can be used to clone an existing craft. When you have
the craft you wish to clone open in your editor:

       craft clone <new craft> <new subcraft> <new command>

Note that, like everything else, crafts should be developed on
the builder port; they will swap over with the worldfile.
