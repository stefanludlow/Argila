Argila2.0 initial
Lua has been included, and the first trigger, TIMER, has ben enabled. 

Argila1-03 - September 1, 2006
A number of small fixes, simplification of the makefile, converted C++ comments to C style, allocate memory for pointer to newly init mobs, set default to LINUX in makefile, use getopt to make command-line argument parsing more robust, use socklen_t as type for size of socket, instead of int. Thanks to Sighentist for all of his patches.

Argila1-02 - August 15, 2006
Fixed the regions/registry file to the Argila1-01 release to deal with combat casuing crash bug. Also, fixed many of the memory issues. Primarily this involves changing lines of the form 

af = malloc(sizeof(AFFECTED_TYPE));

to the form

af = (AFFECTED_TYPE *)alloc(sizeof(AFFECTED_TYPE), 13);
 
 Additionally, all skill related structures are combined into a single structure. The guest login from the first screen has also been removed. These changes are located in nanny.c. A function was added to choose between  greetings.maintenance and the regular greetings menu. Finally, the show v option was tweaked when veiwing the Max-rates option to improve readability.
